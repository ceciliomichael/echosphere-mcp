**Status**: üü¢ Resolved (except large file splits)

## üî¥ Critical

- [x] `[P0]` `[M]` Global fetch not guaranteed by Node engines - `src/services/ai-service.ts:66-85,102-121,155-174`; `package.json:30-32`
  - Category: Correctness
  - Problem: Uses global `fetch` but `package.json` allows Node >=16; Node 16 lacks `fetch`, causing runtime failures.
  - Evidence:
```66:74:src/services/ai-service.ts
const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/embeddings`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,
  },
})
```
```30:32:package.json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=16.0.0"
}
```
  - Fix: Require Node >=18 LTS in `engines`, or add a polyfill (e.g., import `undici` and set `globalThis.fetch = fetch` or use `node-fetch`).
  - Tests: CI matrix for Node 18/20; run an integration test that calls both embeddings and chat endpoints to verify end-to-end.
  - **Fix: Updated `package.json` to require Node >=18.0.0 which includes native fetch support**

- [x] `[P1]` `[M]` Path validation allows symlink escape/case issues - `src/shared/validation.ts:12-28`
  - Category: Security
  - Problem: Uses string prefix check on resolved paths; symlinks inside workspace can point outside, and Windows case-insensitivity is not handled.
  - Evidence:
```12:28:src/shared/validation.ts
const resolvedPath = path.resolve(normalizedRoot, normalizedRelativePath);
if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(normalizedRoot + path.sep) && resolvedPath !== normalizedRoot) {
  throw new Error(`Access denied: Path "${relativePath}" is outside the workspace root`);
}
```
  - Fix: Compare real paths. Resolve both workspace and candidate with `await fs.realpath(...)`, then ensure `path.relative(realRoot, realCandidate)` does not start with `..` and is not empty; on Windows compare using a case-insensitive check.
  - Tests: Unit tests for `..` traversal, absolute path input, and symlink pointing outside workspace on Windows and POSIX.
  - **Fix: Converted to async function using `fs.realpath()` for both workspace root and target path, added `path.relative()` validation to detect `..` escapes, added case-insensitive validation for Windows, and handles non-existent paths by validating parent directories**

## üîß Performance

- [x] `[P2]` `[S]` File reader returns unbounded content size - `src/tools/file-reader.ts:108-126`
  - Problem: Returns full file contents for up to 50 files; very large files will bloat responses and slow tools.
  - Evidence:
```108:126:src/tools/file-reader.ts
// Add file contents
for (let i = 0; i < relativePaths.length; i++) {
  const relativePath = relativePaths[i];
  responseText += `${relativePath}:\n`;
  // Find the file with this exact path
  const file = allFiles.find(f => f.path === relativePath);
  const errorResult = allErrors.find(e => e.includes(relativePath));
  if (file) {
    responseText += `${file.content}\n\n`;
  } else if (errorResult) {
    responseText += `Error: ${errorResult}\n\n`;
  } else {
    responseText += `Error: File not found or could not be read\n\n`;
  }
}
```
  - Fix: Enforce a max byte limit per file (e.g., 256 KB) and total response size (e.g., 1‚Äì2 MB). Truncate with a clear message and provide an option to stream or paginate.
  - Tests: Add tests for large files to assert truncation and for multi-file batches to cap total size.
  - **Fix: Created `src/constants/file-reader-config.ts` with MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES (256KB) and MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_BYTES (2MB) constants; implemented per-file truncation and total response size limiting with clear truncation messages in file-reader.ts**

- [x] `[P2]` `[M]` Full sort for top-K similarity - `src/services/ai-service.ts:231-236`
  - Problem: Sorting all candidates is O(n log n). For large memory stores, selecting top-K with a min-heap reduces overhead.
  - Evidence:
```231:236:src/services/ai-service.ts
return withScores
  .filter(item => item.score >= threshold)
  .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
  .slice(0, topK);
```
  - Fix: Use a bounded min-heap or partial selection (quickselect) to compute top-K without sorting all.
  - Tests: Micro-benchmarks on stores with 10k+ chunks; regression tests for ordering and filtering.
  - **Fix: Implemented MinHeap class for efficient O(n log k) top-K selection instead of O(n log n) full sort; maintains bounded heap of size k during iteration, only sorting final k results**

## üì¶ Code Quality

- [x] `[P2]` `[M]` Duplicate memory persistence logic - `src/shared/file-operations.ts:259-412` vs `src/services/rag-memory-service.ts:211-310,370-540`
  - Problem: Two different memory implementations (plain JSON vs chunked RAG store) can diverge and confuse maintainers.
  - Evidence: Separate `loadMemory/saveMemory` exist in shared utilities while tools use the RAG service.
  - Fix: Remove or deprecate the shared memory functions in `src/shared/file-operations.ts` and route all memory operations through `rag-memory-service`.
  - Tests: Update/align tests to cover a single memory API; verify backward compatibility or provide a migration.
  - **Fix: Deprecated `loadMemory()` and `saveMemory()` functions in file-operations.ts with @deprecated JSDoc annotations and runtime warnings; added clear documentation to route new code to ragMemoryService; functions retained for backward compatibility**

- [x] `[P3]` `[S]` Weak typing for chat messages - `src/services/ai-service.ts:141-153`
  - Problem: `messages` is inferred as `any[]`, reducing type safety.
  - Evidence:
```141:153:src/services/ai-service.ts
const messages = [];
if (systemPrompt) {
  messages.push({ role: "system" as const, content: systemPrompt });
}
messages.push({ role: "user" as const, content: prompt });
```
  - Fix: Define a `ChatMessage` union type and type `messages: ChatMessage[]`.
  - Tests: Type-level tests or compile-time checks; ensure only valid roles are accepted.
  - **Fix: Created `src/shared/chat-types.ts` with ChatMessage interface and role types; updated ai-service.ts to use `messages: ChatMessage[]` with proper typing**

- [x] `[P3]` `[S]` Unused response types - `src/shared/types.ts:12-26,30-33`
  - Problem: `SingleFileResponse`/`MultipleFilesResponse` are defined but not returned by tools.
  - Evidence: Tools return `ToolResponse` text instead of the structured types.
  - Fix: Either adopt these structured response types in tools or remove them to avoid confusion.
  - Tests: Update tool responses and add unit tests validating response shape.
  - **Fix: Removed unused SingleFileResponse and MultipleFilesResponse interfaces from src/shared/types.ts**

## üßπ Maintainability

- [x] `[P2]` `[S]` Verbose error logging may leak sensitive payloads - `src/services/ai-service.ts:92-94,182-184`; `src/services/rag-memory-service.ts:304,450,520,534`; `src/tools/save-memory.ts:87-95`
  - Problem: Logging upstream errors and generated content can leak sensitive information into logs.
  - Evidence: Multiple `console.error(...)` calls with raw error objects/messages.
  - Fix: Sanitize logs; log status codes and stable identifiers only. Gate verbose logs behind an env flag (e.g., `DEBUG`), and redact user content.
  - Tests: Unit tests to verify redaction; integration tests with `DEBUG=false` ensure minimal logging.
  - **Fix: Created `src/utils/logger.ts` with sanitized logging functions (logError, logInfo, logWarning); replaced all console.error calls across ai-service, rag-memory-service, and all tools; logs are now gated behind DEBUG env variable and sensitive data is redacted**

- [x] `[P3]` `[S]` Magic numbers for chunking and thresholds - `src/services/rag-memory-service.ts:16-19`
  - Problem: Hard-coded sizes and thresholds hinder tuning across deployments.
  - Evidence:
```16:19:src/services/rag-memory-service.ts
private readonly CHUNK_SIZE = 800;
private readonly CHUNK_OVERLAP = 120;
private readonly SIMILARITY_DEDUP_THRESHOLD = 0.95;
```
  - Fix: Move to `src/constants/` and/or read from env with sane defaults; document trade-offs.
  - Tests: Config-driven tests validating behavior under different thresholds.
  - **Fix: Created `src/constants/rag-config.ts` with configurable constants (CHUNK_SIZE, CHUNK_OVERLAP, SIMILARITY_DEDUP_THRESHOLD) supporting env variables with documented trade-offs; updated rag-memory-service to import from constants**

- [x] `[P3]` `[S]` Case-sensitive hardcoded ignore entry - `src/tools/check-structure.ts:66-67`
  - Problem: Ignores `agents.md` by exact case; may be brittle across platforms.
  - Evidence:
```66:67:src/tools/check-structure.ts
// Project specific files
'agents.md'
```
  - Fix: Normalize names to a common case before matching or use path-aware globbing.
  - Tests: Add cases with varying filename cases on Windows/Unix.
  - **Fix: Updated shouldIgnore() function in check-structure.ts to normalize both filenames and patterns to lowercase before comparison, ensuring case-insensitive matching across all platforms**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Large Files (300+ lines)

- [x] `[P2]` `[L]` `src/services/rag-memory-service.ts` (601 lines)
  - Problem: Mixes chunking, similarity search, deduplication, persistence, and RAG orchestration.
  - Evidence: Multiple private helpers and concerns in one class.
  - Fix: Extract to modules: `chunker`, `deduplicator`, `store` (I/O), `retrieval`, and a thin `rag-memory-service` facade.
  - Tests: Regression tests for each module; integration tests for end-to-end save/load.
  - **Fix: Split into modular components - created `src/services/chunker.ts` (TextChunker for intelligent text splitting with boundary detection), `src/services/deduplicator.ts` (content hash and similarity-based deduplication), `src/services/memory-store.ts` (MemoryStoreService for persistence/I/O), `src/services/retrieval.ts` (RetrievalService for similarity search, semantic firewall, and relevance categorization); refactored `rag-memory-service.ts` to a thin 360-line facade that orchestrates these services**

- [ ] `[P2]` `[L]` `src/shared/file-operations.ts` (446 lines)
  - Problem: Combines file I/O, directory traversal, move/rename, and an alternate memory API.
  - Evidence: Many unrelated utilities in one file.
  - Fix: Split into `file-io.ts`, `fs-mutations.ts` (move/rename), and remove/deprecate memory functions (moved to service layer).
  - Tests: Unit tests per module; end-to-end tests for move/rename.
